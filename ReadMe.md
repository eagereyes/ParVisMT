# ParVisMT

This is a research prototype used to test multi-touch interaction in parallel coordinates using the multi-touch trackpads on Apple's recent MacBook and MacBook Pro laptops. This is part of a paper that is currently under review. More information will be forthcoming here once the paper is accepted.

The data is currently hardcoded, so this is not a useful program. It is only meant to demonstrate the speed and ease of interaction when using multi-touch interaction (especially compared to programs like the [Java version of ParVis](http://github.com/eagereyes/ParVis))

Watch the video to see the interactions that are possible: [http://vimeo.com/13437693](http://vimeo.com/13437693)

## Magic Keys

Since the mouse cannot be used in the program, these keys can be used to change settings.

* `o` ... toggles the overlay that shows the position of the fingers on the trackpad relative to the projected axes.
* `f` ... toggles fullscreen mode. Especially useful because the window can sometimes lose focus otherwise. Use the escape key or `f` again to leave fullscreen mode.
* `m` ... toggles the mouse. This is mostly to demonstrate why it's a bad idea to have a visible mouse pointer when doing multi-touch interaction.
